# Auth Hackathon

A pair programming project to use Auth0. We built the Gringotts Harry Potter bank - your gold is super secure! 

A hackathon task as a part of the School of Code bootcamp. The focus was on implementing the Auth0 secure sign in service.
We could build whatever we liked, the only requirement is that a user must have to log in to use it.

We used React and Auth0 to build a Harry Potter Gringott's bank account application.

## Auth options

**Auth0**

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is a service that will allow you to have users sign into your project. The docs are good and [this tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react) will help you integrate it with react.
